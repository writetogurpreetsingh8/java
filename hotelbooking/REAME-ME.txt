Hi Team

I have used spring-boot & java8 to develop this apis and I have used Swagger to test for the same

Swagger url -> http://localhost:8080/hotelbooking/swagger-ui.html

Validation and exception handling is there but due to time constraint I couldn't able to put logging and Junit for it
Number of room in the hotel in configurable in the property file

Some assumptions I have made while coding to make it simple :-
 
1)  1.1) At a time only one hotel room can be associated with given Date
			i.e  if we book room 101 for the date of 2020-08-23 and 
			again try to book same room(101) for the date of 2020-08-24 
			Then old booking would be overwrite
	1.2) If we try to book same hotel room again for the dame date then
			system would generate an exception as per requirments mentioned in the DOC

2) System will only accept present/current or Future data , not accepting past-date anywhere in the system 	

3) System would generate JSON as response either success or failure


To review the code easly, import it into eclipse/STS and run through maven commands
i.e mvn spring-boot:run

I have also provided the jar file named hotelbooking.txt , just need to change its extension (txt to jar) before execute

on cmd-promt -> java -jar hotelbooking.jar
